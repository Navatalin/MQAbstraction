# MQAbstraction

This library is being build to provide examples of how to abstract the interraction with message queue software.

It utilizes Dependancy Injection to resolve dependancies for each of the message queue implementations.

By passing the configuration to each implementation the appsettings.json file can include specific fields dependant on which MQ implementation is being used.

Over all this is primarily for education and practice, feel free to leave any comments or raise a pull request with suggested fixes/alternative ways to do things.
